# BuildALibrary

- focused on creating classes that are containers, i.e. classes which hold multiple things. 
- book.h and main.cc file was already written for me. The class includes private variables for:
•	Title
•	Author
•	Copyright date
•	Number of pages

created a Library class with functions that allow for
•	The input of an additional book
•	A listing of all the books in the library in the order in which they are currently stored
•	An output of the number of books in the library
•	An output of the total number of pages in the library
•	Sort the library by copyright date, ascending
•	Sort the library by title, ascending
•	Search for a particular book by title, outputting all the information about that book
•	Search for all the books by a particular author, outputting all the information about each book
•	Removal of a book from the library, in case your friend didn’t return that one he borrowed last year.

- file back-up for the library. (shelf.txt)
- wrote member functions for:
•	load 
•	save
